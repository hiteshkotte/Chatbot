        <h2>About the Chatbot</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>BiWi AI Tutor</strong> is a cutting-edge intelligent chatbot designed to revolutionize the way students engage with 
            learning materials in the field of educational sciences. Built on advanced <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong>, the chatbot 
            leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver precise and context-aware answers tailored to individual queries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Its primary goal is to support students in higher education by providing scalable, personalized mentorship and guidance. 
            The chatbot serves as both a knowledgeable expert and a supportive learning companion, capable of addressing a wide range 
            of inquiries, from course-specific content to organizational details.
        </p>
        <p>
            Designed with self-directed learning in mind, the BiWi AI Tutor adapts to diverse learning contexts, offering timely feedback 
            and fostering deeper engagement with course material. Whether answering questions about lecture slides, seminar texts, or 
            organizational processes, the chatbot ensures students have the resources they need at their fingertips, 24/7.
        </p>
        <p>
            The chatbot supports a wide range of use cases, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Clarifying key concepts from lectures and seminar materials.</li>
                <li>Providing quick answers to organizational queries, such as deadlines and schedules.</li>
                <li>Offering guidance on self-directed learning strategies and feedback on student progress.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The chatbot operates through a robust architecture that combines multiple layers of functionality:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Document Parsing and Retrieval:</strong> Course materials, including lecture slides, seminar texts, and organizational 
                information, are parsed and indexed using the <strong>LlamaIndex</strong> library. This allows the chatbot to access specific 
                chunks of knowledge that are most relevant to a given query.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Contextual Understanding:</strong> By utilizing semantic search techniques and embedding-based retrieval, the chatbot 
                ensures it delivers precise and relevant responses. A hybrid approach of keyword-based and semantic similarity-based retrievers 
                further enhances the accuracy of the information retrieved.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>RAG Workflow:</strong> The chatbot employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation to combine retrieved content with 
                generative capabilities, creating comprehensive, contextually accurate answers. This technique ensures that students receive 
                responses enriched by pre-existing learning materials while also leveraging the reasoning power of LLMs.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Students interact with the BiWi AI Tutor through a simple and intuitive web-based interface. Queries are processed through 
            a pipeline that dynamically selects the most relevant learning material using retrievers and rerankers. These retrieved materials 
            are then fed into the LLM, which generates detailed answers that are not only correct but also accompanied by explanations 
            for deeper understanding.

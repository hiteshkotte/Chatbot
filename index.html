    <h2>About the Chatbot</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>BiWi AI Tutor</strong> is an innovative chatbot developed to enhance learning experiences in the field of educational sciences. 
        It integrates advanced <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> with <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> to provide precise, 
        context-aware responses to a variety of student queries.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This chatbot addresses the challenges of scalable, personalized mentorship in higher education by serving two primary roles:
        as a knowledgeable expert answering course-specific and organizational questions, and as a supportive mentor guiding 
        self-directed learning. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Students can interact with the BiWi AI Tutor through a user-friendly web interface. By simply typing their questions—whether 
        they pertain to lecture content, seminar topics, or administrative information—they can receive comprehensive and accurate 
        responses within seconds. The chatbot retrieves relevant information from course materials, processes it, and generates 
        a tailored answer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The chatbot supports a wide range of use cases, such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Clarifying key concepts from lectures and seminar materials.</li>
            <li>Providing quick answers to organizational queries, such as deadlines and schedules.</li>
            <li>Offering guidance on self-directed learning strategies and feedback on student progress.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Built with <strong>scalability</strong> and <strong>flexibility</strong> in mind, the BiWi AI Tutor operates 24/7, ensuring students have access 
        to timely support whenever needed. Whether for a quick clarification or in-depth guidance, this chatbot is designed 
        to make learning more accessible, engaging, and efficient.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Additionally, the system is designed with privacy and security as top priorities. All interactions are processed securely, 
        ensuring that sensitive student data remains protected. The chatbot also provides explanations for its answers, making it 
        not only a tool for assistance but also a resource for deeper understanding.
